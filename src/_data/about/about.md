# HeyðŸ‘‹, it's Louis Gustavo, Software Engineer at Traveloka

Ever since I was a high school student, software engineering has been my passion. I vividly recalled the time I first built a program for an Arduino Uno to make a miniature traffic light system. Additionally, modifying my [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com/) profile page's theme with HTML and CSS sparked my interest in software engineering. These experiences have significantly contributed to who I am today.

I'm a **Software Engineer** at [Traveloka](https://traveloka.com) and **summa cum laude Computer Science graduate** from [BINUS University](https://binus.ac.id/) with **a GPA of 3.94**. During my yearlong internship as **Software Development Engineer** at [Blibli.com](https://blibli.com), I demonstrated my skills in software engineering and front-end development by developing micro-frontends and enhancing existing internal applications. With over three years of web development experience, my expertise spans across web development using Vue.js, React, JavaScript, SCSS, Laravel, PHP, SQL, Git, and various CI/CD tools.

Previously, I assumed the role of **Manager of Web Development Division** of [HIMTI BINUS University](https://himti.or.id/), a computer science student association at BINUS University. Furthermore, I received the **Mentoring Scholarship Program** at BINUS University for three consecutive semesters, an honor granted to students mantaining a GPA above 3.5 while actively conducting peer-to-peer learning sessions for peers.
